# gradshow-2021-frontend


Hey Everyone, welcome to the Gradshow 2021 Website Build! 

Firstly, thanks for being here and helping out. 

Secondly, it is really important that we keep the communication lines open the whole time throughout this build. 
No one is here a master coder but I am sure anyone would be happy to help out if anyone else gets stuck anywhere, just yell out.

On that note, please be descriptive with your code, add lots of comments so everyone knows what each block of code does, 
add a short but descriptive message to your git commits as well so we can see a bit of a change log. 

If anyone needs help with GIT let me (Louis) know and I will do what I can to try and help out (but I am still guessing what to do too).
