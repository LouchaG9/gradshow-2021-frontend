# gradshow-2021-frontend

note from Julian, 19th of November:

please go to the graduates/19760513 route to view an example of a user profile. 
only basic styling has been applied for now, it still needs media queries. 

here's a live view on the pre-production site: https://gradshow-preprod.netlify.app/graduates/19760513

i've added a masonry grid layout to showcase peoples work, as people have submitted images of varying resolutions:
landscape, portrait, big, small, etc. this grid will automatically fit images in to their best position based on the sizing.

please message me on discord if you can help out with all this profile development, as there is a lot to do.

Hey Everyone, welcome to the Gradshow 2021 Website Build! 

Firstly, thanks for being here and helping out. 

Secondly, it is really important that we keep the communication lines open the whole time throughout this build. 
No one is here a master coder but I am sure anyone would be happy to help out if anyone else gets stuck anywhere, just yell out.

On that note, please be descriptive with your code, add lots of comments so everyone knows what each block of code does, 
add a short but descriptive message to your git commits as well so we can see a bit of a change log. 

If anyone needs help with GIT let me (Louis) know and I will do what I can to try and help out (but I am still guessing what to do too).
