    bio: "An avid sports fan with an intricate plan, I can't wait to make my mark in the design industry. \n\nLet's talk about what I know best... design (in-particular Photoshop) and sports! Throughout my time of juggling university, interning with the Perth Wildcats & Fremantle Dockers, representing Curtin University on the AGDA WA board and staying afloat socially (hardly), I have maintained a high standard of work throughout all aspects of uni. \n\nHanding in 300-400 page process documents became a normality throughout my final year (much to Lee's despair), helping accumulate two vice-chancellors certificates, a head of school commendation and a fabled reputation amongst the tutors. \n\nBetween sports, design, a pint of Swan and a good Chicken Parmi, i'll be a good fit wherever I'm traded. I'm always up for the challenge, am keen to learn and will give 110% for the team. I'm primed and ready, so are you going to take me with your pick in the Curtin 2021 Draft?",

I love how design can emulate someone’s dream or passion into a reality. It’s always so pleasing to see my work on display in the real world. For myself, brand marketing, publication and poster design are my main attributes. \n\nThe last 2 years I’ve been exploring freelance and had the opportunity to intern at The R Collective , a sustainable fashion brand, as a recipient of NCP or the New Colombo mobility plan OR in simpler terms I was supposed to complete my internship in Hong Kong (it’s not like this is the third trip that has been cancelled on me).

When making animations I like to use a mix of 2d frame by frame animation and motion graphic animation. My tutors don't understand why I like to use Premiere Pro for animation and I don’t understand why more people aren’t using it for animation (I also know After Effects too, don’t stress).

I have tried my hand at Stop motion, 3D and 2D animation, but my passion lies in pre-visualisation or storyboarding, because it is where the story gets told and can make or break a production. Contributing to the organisation and betterment of the larger art community is very important to me, and I have gotten involved, tabled, and volunteered in events such as the Perth Comic Arts Festival and Xerox Days Zine Market. I have been a committee member for the Curtin Animation Club and Curtin Illustration Club and this coming year, I will be the President of the Illustration Club. My comics has been published in Myth 5 and 6, and The West Coast Comic Anthology. I always try and get involved wherever I can and was the 2020 WAnimate 3Thirty Tertiary Award Winner, the 2021 WAnimate 48 Hour Animation Challenge winner, the winner of the 2021 Curtin Story Jam Storyboarding Prize and the 2020 Creative Jam Design Competition 2020 winner.

Turn it into something more than just a fleeting thought shelved in an imaginary locker in your brain never to see the light of day? That's what led me here. That and because this degree have no exams. The chance to make something that will put people through a roller coaster of visual and emotional spectacle that leaves them with something new, or being a viewer yourself and being inspired by the work of others. What am I drawn to make? Things involving 3D modelling and illustration, especially stylised works that integrate both 2D and 3D elements. The charm of the design field is how each step is a stairway of growth as you experiment, fail, learn and improve your craft, because your mediocre work today is what leads to your magnum opus tomorrow. Its hard to gauge just how passionate you are at something, but when you get excited at the render finally looking just right by willingly staying up till 3AM, its hard to say you're not invested. Not everyone have the opportunity to turn passion into profession, so its best to try and make the most of it.\n\nAnd remember, stay hydrated.\n\n- Sincerely, me at 3AM\n",

I’ve always been a bit of a social misfit and found it hard to fit in, but if design has taught me anything it’s that those who stand out are the ones who make a lasting impression! It’s this notion of standing out, of being different, that drives me as a designer. Guided by in-depth research and rock-solid strategy I observe what exists in the market and combine creative new concepts with inspiration from even the strangest of places to create brand identities that unapologetically break the mould. I firmly believe that the edge is where truly creative solutions are found so I throw everything I have into each and every project and push myself to achieve an outcome that can please even my own perfectionist tendencies. In my spare time you’ll find me converting my Toyota Coaster bus into a home on wheels, tending to the demands of my screaming hell panther of a cat or obsessing over some new found crafty hobby that will almost certainly be short lived.

I am a creative individual that puts in the hours to get the results that he wants. I like to take on briefs that challenge me and push me to design solutions that are out of my regular style and form. I want clients and consumers to feel the difference in the designs that I create and realise that there is a purpose behind each decision and solution. Through the help of a detailed and in-depth analysis process, conducted on a brand and their strategy, I can confidently provide both sensible and unique solutions that go beyond their regular expectations. This process of mine is supported by the expert education provided by Curtin University, along with experienced knowledge from leaders in the Perth Graphic Design community, as well as other expert Brand Consultants. Over the past few years, I have grown a rapid love hate relationship with the Adobe Creative Suite, especially with Photoshop, Illustrator and Indesign. Luckily, I have acquired a number of skills from those mistakes and successes, and I feel my ability in these programs reflects the passion that I have for this industry. From the projects that I have completed, the amount of effort and passion that I pour into each brief is clearly visible in the final results and client satisfaction. I push myself to include this motivation as an important value of mine is to give the best of myself to each project I contribute to. Looking into the future, I want to continue to develop my knowledge and skills in the Graphic Design and Creative Advertising space, as well as continue to learn from industry leaders so that I too can evolve into a successful leader in this industry.",

My passion for 3D and animation has since bloomed while helping me to explore the depths of my creativity. I'm enraptured by the art of storytelling and have always enjoyed engaging with creative mediums. I recently discovered I have aphantasia, which has only fuelled my passion. Being able to see my creations come to life, compensating for the lack of visuals in my head is incredibly rewarding.\nWhile 3D character design of both humans and animals is my personal passion, I have broadened myself to a 3D generalist as I enjoy other parts of the creative pipeline, including rigging, animation, and environment modelling, as well as gaining significant experience working with game engines. Throughout my studies I have also found a passion for teamwork and love exploring ideas with others to create beautiful stories, be it through games or animations.

I believe that my background in these two complementary disciplines allows me to bring a unique approach to any brief.\n\nThe skills I've gained so far have allowed me to develop brands that create an emotional connection. These skills include; captivating character designs, immersive illustration styles and very strong colour theory. \n\nI have a real passion for creative endeavours that centre around mental health. My natural illustration style evokes a comforting source of escapism, tailor made for these types of projects. \n\nMy passion project at the moment has been illustrating and writing my own graphic novel, alongside creating new products for my small business - Ali Illustrations.\n",

Many of the characters I design range from modern-day humans, to adventure-seeking creatures from high fantasy worlds. Outside of artistic endeavours, I love to play video games, play D&D, watch anime and drink a wide variety of teas!",

    bio: "“Hi! My name is Jet. J-E-T. Like the jet-plane in the sky but without the plane.”  I consider myself a generalist. I am willing to investigate, learn and dive into the various areas and fields. I have a keen interest in 3D Modelling, Texturing and Animation. Creating worlds within a 3D space is quite amazing.  Creating VFX excites me, especially 3D that you can find within animation or games. It's amazing creating particles that grow, flow and dissipate magically.  I also dive into UI/UX. A great user interface can really make or break a product and paying attention to the user’s experience is at the heart of all things design.  Although, my main passion is Game Development. I love making a player feel a sense of awe, fun or excitement.  Overall, working for an Animation or Game studio would be a dream for me.  When I work on projects, I also tend to keep a positive, pleasant but still practical attitude and I believe in a good, pleasant team-working environment to be crucial to success.  In my spare time, you can catch me try-harding to reach Rank 1 in a MOBA, shooters, fighting games, or going out to the city with friends and family for lunch or dinner.  See you around! ",
