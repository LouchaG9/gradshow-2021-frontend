    bio: "An avid sports fan with an intricate plan, I can't wait to make my mark in the design industry. \n\nLet's talk about what I know best... design (in-particular Photoshop) and sports! Throughout my time of juggling university, interning with the Perth Wildcats & Fremantle Dockers, representing Curtin University on the AGDA WA board and staying afloat socially (hardly), I have maintained a high standard of work throughout all aspects of uni. \n\nHanding in 300-400 page process documents became a normality throughout my final year (much to Lee's despair), helping accumulate two vice-chancellors certificates, a head of school commendation and a fabled reputation amongst the tutors. \n\nBetween sports, design, a pint of Swan and a good Chicken Parmi, i'll be a good fit wherever I'm traded. I'm always up for the challenge, am keen to learn and will give 110% for the team. I'm primed and ready, so are you going to take me with your pick in the Curtin 2021 Draft?",

Let’s just say the choice was tough when deciding on my future but eventually I realised I could combine the two, where hopefully in the future I’ll be able to work in the sport industry as a graphic designer. \n\nMy eagerness and determination has allowed me to hone my skills at Curtin, where I am able to mix in photography, illustration and story telling into a variety of projects. I love how design can emulate someone’s dream or passion into a reality. It’s always so pleasing to see my work on display in the real world. For myself, brand marketing, publication and poster design are my main attributes. \n\nThe last 2 years I’ve been exploring freelance and had the opportunity to intern at The R Collective , a sustainable fashion brand, as a recipient of NCP or the New Colombo mobility plan OR in simpler terms I was supposed to complete my internship in Hong Kong (it’s not like this is the third trip that has been cancelled on me).

I value innovative craft, open communication and stretching the limits of ideation to create something truly special.\nA friend once told me to “feed your brain” – a sentiment that has stuck with me and now drives my design process. It pushes me to delve into the most uncommon of places to create unique and strategic design solutions.\nI believe that copy and graphics are intrinsically entwined, that the verbal and visual identity of your brand must have a solid foundation in order to engage positively with new and existing audiences. That’s why I offer both services here at Studio Double Knot, simplifying the search for a copy writer and graphic designer by providing both! A two-in-one deal if you will.\nWhen I’m not huddled over my computer designing away, you’ll find me going for walks in the bush, buying yet ANOTHER book and most definitely cooking up some mushrooms!\n",

I believe the experience of design impacts our everyday lives and provides a relief to our community.\n\nDesign has been in my bones throughout my life. I studied Design in High School, which coincidentally, my mum was my teacher. I have her to thank. She’s taught me about design and passed it down in my very DNA.\nI really did get it from my mama. I never wanted to study design leaving school. After all, both my older sisters were already designers in their fields. No way was I going to be the third designer in the family.\nBut... here I am, graduating in Bachelor of Design at Curtin, and something I’ll never regret doing and wear with pride to be apart of a creative family.",

Whether 2D or 3D, for games, television, or art, my dream is to join a studio team I can work with and learn from. I’ve been inspired by creative storytelling all my life, and I’m eager to use what I’ve learned at Curtin to inspire creativity and passion in the audience I reach. \nIf my work can spark someone’s imagination and inspire them to try being creative, I will have made the positive difference I want to see in the world.",

When designing characters, I enjoy creating contrast and variety within a cast, playing with complementary themes and visual language. If I have the chance, I like incorporating mixed media into my work, such as photography and scanned fabric patterns, to create something that couldn’t be done by illustration alone. When making animations I like to use a mix of 2d frame by frame animation and motion graphic animation. My tutors don't understand why I like to use Premiere Pro for animation and I don’t understand why more people aren’t using it for animation (I also know After Effects too, don’t stress). My main goal for anything I create is for it to be fun. It’s easy for me to get lost in my own world with my own ideas, but I believe it is important to enjoy what you create in order to create something that is enjoyed by others!",

Turn it into something more than just a fleeting thought shelved in an imaginary locker in your brain never to see the light of day? That's what led me here. That and because this degree have no exams. The chance to make something that will put people through a roller coaster of visual and emotional spectacle that leaves them with something new, or being a viewer yourself and being inspired by the work of others. What am I drawn to make? Things involving 3D modelling and illustration, especially stylised works that integrate both 2D and 3D elements. The charm of the design field is how each step is a stairway of growth as you experiment, fail, learn and improve your craft, because your mediocre work today is what leads to your magnum opus tomorrow. Its hard to gauge just how passionate you are at something, but when you get excited at the render finally looking just right by willingly staying up till 3AM, its hard to say you're not invested. Not everyone have the opportunity to turn passion into profession, so its best to try and make the most of it.\n\nAnd remember, stay hydrated.\n\n- Sincerely, me at 3AM\n",

I’ve always been a bit of a social misfit and found it hard to fit in, but if design has taught me anything it’s that those who stand out are the ones who make a lasting impression! It’s this notion of standing out, of being different, that drives me as a designer. Guided by in-depth research and rock-solid strategy I observe what exists in the market and combine creative new concepts with inspiration from even the strangest of places to create brand identities that unapologetically break the mould. I firmly believe that the edge is where truly creative solutions are found so I throw everything I have into each and every project and push myself to achieve an outcome that can please even my own perfectionist tendencies. In my spare time you’ll find me converting my Toyota Coaster bus into a home on wheels, tending to the demands of my screaming hell panther of a cat or obsessing over some new found crafty hobby that will almost certainly be short lived.

I am a creative individual that puts in the hours to get the results that he wants. I like to take on briefs that challenge me and push me to design solutions that are out of my regular style and form. I want clients and consumers to feel the difference in the designs that I create and realise that there is a purpose behind each decision and solution. Through the help of a detailed and in-depth analysis process, conducted on a brand and their strategy, I can confidently provide both sensible and unique solutions that go beyond their regular expectations. This process of mine is supported by the expert education provided by Curtin University, along with experienced knowledge from leaders in the Perth Graphic Design community, as well as other expert Brand Consultants. Over the past few years, I have grown a rapid love hate relationship with the Adobe Creative Suite, especially with Photoshop, Illustrator and Indesign. Luckily, I have acquired a number of skills from those mistakes and successes, and I feel my ability in these programs reflects the passion that I have for this industry. From the projects that I have completed, the amount of effort and passion that I pour into each brief is clearly visible in the final results and client satisfaction. I push myself to include this motivation as an important value of mine is to give the best of myself to each project I contribute to. Looking into the future, I want to continue to develop my knowledge and skills in the Graphic Design and Creative Advertising space, as well as continue to learn from industry leaders so that I too can evolve into a successful leader in this industry.",

    bio: "Since childhood I have loved animals, the natural world and the fantastical, and tried to replicate the feeling of wonder that these awoke inside me. First I followed this to biology before pivoting to animation due to my wish to be able to share my fascination with life with others. My passion for 3D and animation has since bloomed while helping me to explore the depths of my creativity. I'm enraptured by the art of storytelling and have always enjoyed engaging with creative mediums. I recently discovered I have aphantasia, which has only fuelled my passion. Being able to see my creations come to life, compensating for the lack of visuals in my head is incredibly rewarding.\nWhile 3D character design of both humans and animals is my personal passion, I have broadened myself to a 3D generalist as I enjoy other parts of the creative pipeline, including rigging, animation, and environment modelling, as well as gaining significant experience working with game engines. Throughout my studies I have also found a passion for teamwork and love exploring ideas with others to create beautiful stories, be it through games or animations. My dream for the future is to work with other creative individuals on weird and wonderful projects that we can share with the world.",

As a designer, every decision I make is based on differentiating from what’s currently out there, leading me to create intriguing works that challenge audience perceptions in their respective categories.

The way we shape experiences impacts people in more ways than can be summarized by A/B testing or usage metrics. My main goal as a designer (and human) is to ask tricky questions: In what situations could this product cause harm? Is this experience equally accessible for everyone? How can we better protect users’ digital rights? I don’t know the answers, but I do know that it’s really important to consider the broader impacts of the technologies we design. When I’m not pixel-pushing in Figma, I write policy submissions, create informational primers, make vegan nacho dip, and watch sunsets.",

Creating VFX excites me, especially 3D that you can find within animation or games. It's amazing creating particles that grow, flow and dissipate magically.  I also dive into UI/UX. A great user interface can really make or break a product and paying attention to the user’s experience is at the heart of all things design.  Although, my main passion is Game Development. I love making a player feel a sense of awe, fun or excitement.  Overall, working for an Animation or Game studio would be a dream for me.  When I work on projects, I also tend to keep a positive, pleasant but still practical attitude and I believe in a good, pleasant team-working environment to be crucial to success.  In my spare time, you can catch me try-harding to reach Rank 1 in a MOBA, shooters, fighting games, or going out to the city with friends and family for lunch or dinner.  See you around! ",
