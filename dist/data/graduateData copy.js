    bio: "Hey stranger! I’m Emily and there are a few things you should know about me; I’m partial to a bit of 80’s rock music, a good glass of wine and am low-key obsessed with my cat, Sabbath. I’ve always been a bit of a social misfit and found it hard to fit in, but if design has taught me anything it’s that those who stand out are the ones who make a lasting impression! It’s this notion of standing out, of being different, that drives me as a designer. Guided by in-depth research and rock-solid strategy I observe what exists in the market and combine creative new concepts with inspiration from even the strangest of places to create brand identities that unapologetically break the mould. I firmly believe that the edge is where truly creative solutions are found so I throw everything I have into each and every project and push myself to achieve an outcome that can please even my own perfectionist tendencies. In my spare time you’ll find me converting my Toyota Coaster bus into a home on wheels, tending to the demands of my screaming hell panther of a cat or obsessing over some new found crafty hobby that will almost certainly be short lived.
